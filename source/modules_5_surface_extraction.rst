pisa_ccp4_extract
-----------

This module takes as input the .pdb files of protein complexes obtained with the selected docking methodology and 
returns a .tsv file of the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues) and the corresponding .pdb 
file of the best complex, using CCP4 software. File names must be in the format 
ReceptorUniProtKB_database_LigandUniProtKB_database_DockingMethod_name_ComplexName (for instance, P15848_AF_P59665_ditasser_FTDOCK_56.pdb). 
The files must be placed in a folder named LigandUniProtKB_database (for instance, P59665_ditasser) within
the module input folder.

pisa_server_extract
-----------

This module takes as input the .pdb files of protein complexes obtained with the selected docking methodology and returns a .tsv file of 
the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues) and the corresponding .pdb file of the best complex, using the on-line 
PDBePISA website. File names must be in the format 
ReceptorUniProtKB_database_LigandUniProtKB_database_DockingMethod_name_ComplexName (for instance, P15848_AF_P59665_ditasser_FTDOCK_56.pdb). 
The files must be placed in a folder named LigandUniProtKB_database (for instance, P59665_ditasser) within
the module input folder.


pisa_xml_extract
-----------

This module takes as input one or more xml files of protein complexes generated by the PDBePISA server and returns a summary (.tsv file) 
of the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues). To use this utility with more than one protein pair, please 
create a main input folder and create as many folders inside it as there are protein pairs to be analyzed. The name of each folder should follow 
the structure: LigandUniProtKB_database (for instance, P59665_ditasser). Each folder should contain one or more PISAePDB xml files. 
This module should only be used, if you have XML files from the PDBePISA server.
