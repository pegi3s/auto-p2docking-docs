Surface extraction
**************

pisa_ccp4_extract
-----------

This module takes as input the .pdb files of protein complexes obtained with the selected docking methodology and returns a .tsv file of the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues) and the corresponding .pdb file of the best complex, using CCP4 software.

pisa_server_extract
-----------

This module takes as input the .pdb files of protein complexes obtained with the selected docking methodology and returns a .tsv file of the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues) and the corresponding .pdb file of the best complex, using the on-line PDBePISA website.

pisa_xml_extract
-----------

This module takes as input one or more xml files of protein complexes generated by the PDBePISA server and returns a summary (.tsv file) of the best protein complex (highest number of interacting residues). To use this utility with more than one protein pair, please create a main input folder and create as many folders inside it as there are protein pairs to be analyzed. Each folder should contain one or more PISAePDB xml
files. This module should only be used, if you have XML files from the PDBePISA server.
