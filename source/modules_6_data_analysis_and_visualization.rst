Data analysis and visualization
***************

tabulate
---

This module takes as input .tsv files (generated by the pisa_server_extract, pisa_ccp4_extract, or pisa_xml_extract modules; present in the input folder) and creates a table with all the receptor ligand sites when in complex with each one of the ligands.

get_pattern
---

This module takes as input the table created by the tabulate module and returns a file named pattern_regions.txt with the pattern positions for structure 1 according to the
rule and the cutoff value specified in the auto-p2docking configuration file.

Example:
pattern_cutoff=50
pattern=“111[01]1”

Parameter description:
- pattern_cutoff= specify the percentage above which the site is assigned
as "1" in the rule pattern. In the example given is 50
- pattern= specify the pattern rule. In the example given is “111[01]1”, which
means that a region is defined as a sequence of at least three sites with
more than 50% frequency, which can be separated by a site with less than
50% frequency if the next site is also present in more than 50% of the
cases.

highlight_regions
---

This module applies colors to the PDB structure to highlight regions of interest, based on the pattern_regions.txt file created by the get_pattern module. Chain A (receptor) and B (ligand) are colored green and blue respectively, and pattern amino acid sites are colored red. This module also uses pymol (https://pymol.org/) to save a png file of the colored structure. The output directory will contain the pseudo colored .pdb files and the corresponding .png files.
